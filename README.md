# ðŸ•¹ Hot Seat Games

A simple [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) minigames engine for multiple players on the same computer. Created as a **Java learning project** for the students of my OOP programming class at the *[Institute for Digital Humanities](https://github.com/DH-Cologne)* ([University of Cologne](https://uni-koeln.de/)).

## How to play

You have **three options** here:

1. Download the (*possibly outdated, probably up to date*) [current release](https://github.com/bkis/HotSeatGames/releases) and run it with `java -jar HotSeatGames.jar`, **OR**
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE and run it from there (*for development*), **OR**
3. Use your IDE (or your hacker skills and `javac` ðŸ¤“) to create a runnable `.jar` file from the [current project source](https://github.com/bkis/HotSeatGames/archive/main.zip), then run it with `java -jar HotSeatGames.jar`!

## How to add new games

If you want to add new games, just follow these steps:

1. Create a package with your game's name under `idh.hotseatgames.games` (e.g. `idh.hotseatgames.games.mygame`).
2. Create a game class (preferably matching your packages name, e.g. `MyGame`) inside the package you just created. This game class must implement the `IGame` interface correctly to work with *Hot Seat Games*. Please **read the documentation** of the `IGame` interface's methods and stick to the conventions explained there! Furthermore, you are free to use the [very helpful utility classes](https://github.com/bkis/HotSeatGames/tree/main/src/idh/hotseatgames/utils) in `idh.hotseatgames.utils`. A final hint: Try to take inspiration from the existing games' implementations! Everything else is up to you.
3. Add your game package and class name to the static array `GAMES_SUB_PATHS` in the `GameManager` class to "register" your game with the *Hot Seat Games* Engine.

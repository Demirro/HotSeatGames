# ðŸ•¹ Hot Seat Games

A simple [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)-based minigames engine with a growing collection of games. It works for multiple players on the same computer using [hot seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotseat_(multiplayer_mode)) mode. This project was created as a fun **Java learning project** for the students of my programming class at the *[Institute for Digital Humanities](https://github.com/DH-Cologne)* ([University of Cologne](https://uni-koeln.de/)).

## How to play

You have **three options**:

1. Download the (*possibly outdated, probably up to date*) [current release](https://github.com/bkis/HotSeatGames/releases) and run it with `java -jar HotSeatGames.jar`, **or**
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE and run it from there (*for development*), **or**
3. Build an executable yourself by using your IDE (or your hacker skills and `javac`) from the [current project source](https://github.com/bkis/HotSeatGames/archive/main.zip), then run it with `java -jar HotSeatGames.jar`!

## How to add new games

If you want to add new games, just follow these steps:

1. Create a package with your game's name under `idh.hotseatgames.games` (e.g. `idh.hotseatgames.games.mygame`).
2. Create a game class (preferably matching your packages name, e.g. `MyGame`) inside the package you just created. This game class must implement the `IGame` interface correctly to work with *Hot Seat Games*. Please **read the documentation** of the `IGame` interface's methods and stick to the conventions explained there! Furthermore, you are free to use the [very helpful utility classes](https://github.com/bkis/HotSeatGames/tree/main/src/idh/hotseatgames/utils) in `idh.hotseatgames.utils`. Try to take inspiration from the existing games' implementations! Everything else is up to you.
3. Add your game classes package path to the static array `GAMES_SUB_PATHS` in the `GameManager` class to "register" your game with the *Hot Seat Games* engine. *(It's not the most elegant way of doing this, but this project tries to avoid any external dependencies for reflection etc.)*
4. If you think your game should be a part of the collection coming with this project, feel free to [contribute](#contributing) it!
